    <h1>Local Storage API, Storing and Retrieving Simple Data, Arrays, Associative Arrays, and Objects</h1>
    <p>We can add data on the browser in two ways, with local storage and with sessions.</p>
    <p>With local storage the data doesn't get cleaned up automatically, with sessions, the data is lost when the browser closes.</p>
    
    <p>Here's an example of data stored that was stored locally, printed out:</p>
    <div id="class"></div>
    
   <p>Here's an example using local storage to get a list of colors from the user and print them out one by one, using an array.</p>
    <h2>Enter Your Favorite Colors:</h2>
    <form>
        <input id="item" type="text" placeholder="New" required />
        <input type="submit">
    </form>
    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <ul></ul>
    <button>Clear All</button>
