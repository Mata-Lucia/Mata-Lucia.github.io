    <h1>Manipulating CSS Class Properties Using JavaScript</h1>
    <p>We can change the style of HTML elements with JavaScript. For example, we can select all the elements with the "blue" class and loop through them to style them:</p>
    <button onclick="addColor()">Add Color</button>
    <p>We believe in <span class="blue">God</span>, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, <span class="blue">Jesus Christ</span>, and in the <span class="blue">Holy Ghost</span>.</p>

    <p>We can also select by Id to style elements using Javascript:</p>
    <button onclick="addStyle()">Add Style</button>
    <p id="article2">We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adamâ€™s transgression.</p>

    <p>Another thing we can do is use toggle to add a class to an element, for example:</p>
    <button onclick="toggleClass()">Add Class</button>
    <div id="article3">
    <p>We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We can also use Set Attribute to change the style of an element:</p>
    <button onclick="changeStyle()">Change Style</button>
    <p id="article4">We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
