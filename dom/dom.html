    <h1>DOM Manipulation</h1>
    <p>We are able to manipulate HTML with Javascript. First we need to select an element, like in this example:</p>
    <p>We believe in God, the <span id="red">Eternal Father</span>, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <button onclick="showRed()">See red Text</button>
    
    <h2>Create Element</h2>
    <p>We can use Create Element to create an HTML element. In this example we create a paragraph:</p>
    <button onclick="createP()">Create Paragraph</button>
    <div id="paragraph"></div>
    <p>And in this example, we add a button:</p>
    <button onclick="addButton()">Add Button</button>
    <div id="button"></div>
    
    <h2>Append Child</h2>
    <p>Append Child is used together with create element to attach the new element to the html. We can use append child to move an element to a different place:</p>
    <button onclick="moveText()">Move Text</button>
    <p> We believe that through the <span id="text">Atonement of Christ</span>, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.</p>
    <div id="newPlace"></div>
    
    <h2>Insert Before</h2>
    <p>Insert Before is used to insert an element before another one. It takes two parameters. Here's an example:</p>
    <button onclick="addP()">Add Title</button>
    <div id="container">
    <p id="article4">We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <h3 id="article4Title">Fourth Article of Faith</h3>
    </div>

    <h2>Remove Child</h2>
    <p>Remove Child can be used to remove an element, like in this example:</p>
    <button onclick="remove()">Remove Title</button>
    <div id="fifthDiv">
    <h3 id="article5Title">Fifth Article of Faith</h3>
    <p>We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Replace Child</h2>
    <p>With Replace Child we can swap two elements, like in this example:</p>
    <button onclick="replace()">Replace Title</button>
    <div id="sixDiv">
    <h3 id="title6a">Article of Faith 6</h3>
    <p>We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.</p>
    <h3 id="title6b">Sixth Article of Faith</h3>
    </div>
